            <p id="intro"><strong>GRADE 9:</strong> I entered a "Youth in Trades Class and discovered the world of coding and robotics. I was given the opportunities to create mini python projects and by=uild programmable robots. Ever since then my interest in this industry has grown. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>GRADE 10:</strong> Covid arrived and I was able to attend class on a quartely basis. I attended a class called Web Development 10 which introduced me to the world of Website Building and Deceloping (HTML, CSS, JS) -- I was able to achieve a 100% in that class. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>GRADE 11:</strong> Programming 11. We did a lot of Wed Development with additional python. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>GRADE 12:</strong> Programming 12 was based on Python. But because I wanted to expand my horizons I enrolled in a class at KPU on C++. I was able to achieve a B in that class. <br>
